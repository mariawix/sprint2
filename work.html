                        The international trade in chinchilla fur goes back to the 16th century. Their fur is popular in the fur
                        trade due to its extremely soft feel, which is caused by the sprouting of 60 hairs (on average) from
                        each hair follicle. The color is usually very even, which makes it ideal for small garments or the
                        lining of large garments, though some large garments can be made entirely from the fur. A single,
                        full-length coat made from chinchilla fur may require as many as 150 pelts, as chinchillas are
                        relatively small. Their use for fur led to the extinction of one species, and put serious pressure on
                        the other two. Though it is illegal to hunt wild chinchillas, the wild animals are now on the verge of
                        becoming extinct because of continued illegal hunting. Domesticated chinchillas are still bred for fur.

                        Chinchillas require extensive exercise. Their teeth need to be worn down, as they grow continuously and
                        can prevent them from eating if they become overgrown. Wooden sticks, pumice stone and chew toys are
                        good options, but conifer and citrus woods (such as cedar or orange) should be avoided because of the
                        high content of resins, oils and phenols that are toxic for chinchillas. Birch, willow, apple, manzanita
                        or kiln-dried pine woods are all safe for chinchillas to chew.

                        The chinchilla is often used as an animal model in researching the auditory system, because the
                        chinchilla's range of hearing (20 Hz to 30 kHz) and cochlear size is close to that of a human, and the
                        chinchilla cochlea is fairly easy to access. Other research fields in which chinchillas are used as an
                        animal model include the study of Chagas disease, gastrointestinal diseases, pneumonia, and listeriosis,
                        as well as of Yersinia and Pseudomonas infections.
