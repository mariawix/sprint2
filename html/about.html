                    <p>
                        Chinchillas originate from high altitudes of the Andes Mountains that runs along the western coast
                        of South America, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. It is about six hundred
                        miles long and two hundred miles wide. This mountainous area has a desert like appearance with very
                        little rainfall and little vegetation.

                    <p>
                        The chinchilla received its name from the Spanish who named it after the Chincha Indians, who had
                        used the fur and introduced it to the Incas. Chinchilla means <em>Little Chincha</em> in Spanish.
                        When the Spaniards discovered them, they were already wearing furs. In the 1400â€™s they began to
                        expand their Empire, continuing over the next 100 years. During this expansion, they conquered many
                        tribes, including the Chinchas, who had used the chinchilla for clothing, food, and pets and used
                        the fur to weave blankets.

                        Chinchilla fur is amongst the most rare and expensive in the world. It takes 100-150 pelts for a
                        waist length coat and at least 250 for a full-length coat. In the 19th century, demand from the
                        European and American markets drove the chinchilla population almost to the brink of extinction.
                        Before the alarmed governments of Chile, Bolivia, Peru & Argentina imposed a ban on their hunting,
                        an estimated 21 million had been killed for their fur.

                        The pet chinchillas we have today owe their origins to a mining engineer named <em>Mathias F
                        Chapman</em>. In 1923, he succeeded to bring 11 live chinchillas to America by bringing them down
                        the mountains slowly enough to allow them to acclimatize. The ship to California also carried ice to
                        keep the chinchillas cool. One female even gave birth whilst on board. They appear to eat a wide
                        variety of plants that can be found at altitude in the Andes, making the most of seasonal fruits and
                        seeds. They use their dexterity and intelligence to find food that may be relatively inaccessible to
                        other animals. They weight between 600g and 900g, with females generally are larger and heavier than
                        males.
